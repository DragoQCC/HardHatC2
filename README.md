HardHat is a multiplayer C# .NET-based command and control framework. Designed to aid in red team engagements and penetration testing. HardHat aims to improve the quality of life factors during engagements by providing an easy-to-use but still robust C2 framework.    
It contains three primary components, an ASP.NET teamserver, a blazor .NET client, and C# based implants.

- Managers (Listeners) 
- Dynamic Payload Generation (Exe, Dll, shellcode, PowerShell command)
- Creation & editing of C2 profiles on the fly in the client
- Customization of payload generation 
  - sleep time/jitter 
  - kill date

# Documentation
documentation can be found at [docs](https://docs.hardhat-c2.net/)

# Getting Started 
## Prerequisites
- Installation of the [.net 7 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0) from Microsoft 
- Once installed, the teamserver and client are started with dotnet run
### Teamserver
To configure the team server's starting address (where clients will connect), edit the HardHatC2\TeamServer\Properties\LaunchSettings.json changing the "applicationUrl": "https://127.0.0.1:5000" to the desired location and port. 
start the teamserver with dotnet run from its top-level folder ../HrdHatC2/Teamserver/

### HardHat Client 
1. When starting the client to set the target teamserver location, include it in the command line dotnet run https://127.0.0.1:5000 for example 
2. open a web browser and navigate to https://localhost:7096/ if this works, you should see the login page 
3. Log in with the HardHat_Admin user (Password is printed on first TeamServer startup)
4. Navigate to the settings page & create a new user if successful, a  message should appear, then you may log in with that account to access the full client
