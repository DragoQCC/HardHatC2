# HardHat C2

## A cross-platform, collaborative, Command & Control framework written in C#, designed for red teaming and ease of use

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15575425/228551034-e07df233-63f6-41a2-8b94-6eb840859e82.png)

HardHat is a multi-user C# .NET-based command and control (C2) framework designed to aid in red team engagements and penetration testing. It aims to improve quality-of-life during engagements by providing a robust, easy-to-use C2 framework.

HardHat has three main components:

1. An ASP.NET teamserver
2. A Blazor .NET client
3. Built-in C# based implants
   - Support for 3rd party implants in other languages   

Full documentation is available at [https://docs.hardhat-c2.net/](https://docs.hardhat-c2.net/).

**NOTE**: HardHat is in an Alpha release; it will have bugs, missing features, and unexpected things will happen. Thank you for trying it, and please report back any issues or missing features so they can be addressed.

## Community

Join our [Discord][Discord] community to talk about HardHat C2, programming, red teaming and general cyber security topics. It's also a great place to ask for help, submit bugs or new features, and stay up-to-date on the latest additions.

Code contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit feature requests, pull requests, or send me your ideas on [Discord][Discord].

## Features

## Getting Started

### Installation

#### Docker

1. Install Docker and Docker Compose
2. Run `docker compose up -d`
    - Optionally, provide `HARDHAT_ADMIN_USERNAME` and/or `HARDHAT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` as environment variables; if omitted, the default admin username and randomly generated password will be written to the teamserver logs on first run
3. Navigate to [https://localhost:7096/](https://localhost:7096/) in your browser

#### Manual

1. Install [.NET 7 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0) from Microsoft
2. Run `dotnet run` from the `.\TeamServer` directory to build and start the teamserver
3. Run `dotnet run https://<TEAMSERVER_HOST>:<TEAMSERVER_PORT>` from the `HardHatC2Client` directory
    - For example, assuming your teamserver is running on the same host and default port: `dotnet run https://127.0.0.1:5000`
4. Navigate to [https://localhost:7096/](https://localhost:7096/) in your browser

To configure the teamserver's listening address (i.e., where clients will connect), edit `.\TeamServer\Properties\LaunchSettings.json` and change `"applicationUrl": "https://127.0.0.1:5000"` to the desired location and port.

### Setup

1. Login to the client web UI using the username and password set with environment variable or printed to STDOUT by the teamserver
2. Navigate to the Settings page and create a new user account
    - If successful, a message will appear; you may then login with that account to access the full client
